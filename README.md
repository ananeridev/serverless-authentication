## How to Use Serverless and JWT Together

**Serverless and JWT can be used together to build secure and scalable applications.**

Here's a simple example of how to use JWTs with a serverless API that I use in this project:

:white_check_mark: User Login: The user provides their credentials (e.g., username and password) to the serverless API.

:white_check_mark: Credential Validation: The serverless API validates the user's credentials against a database or another authentication service. If the credentials are valid, proceed to the next step.

:white_check_mark: JWT Generation: Upon successful validation, the serverless API generates a JWT containing the user's relevant information (e.g., user ID, roles).

:white_check_mark: JWT Response: The generated JWT is sent back to the user as a response to their login request.

:white_check_mark: JWT Inclusion: The user includes the received JWT in any subsequent requests to protected resources.

:white_check_mark: JWT Extraction: The serverless API extracts the JWT from the request header or body.

:white_check_mark: JWT Verification: The serverless API verifies the authenticity and integrity of the JWT using the signing secret.

:white_check_mark: User Identification: If the JWT is valid, the serverless API extracts the user's information from the JWT.

:white_check_mark: Authorization Decision: Based on the user's information, the serverless API determines whether the user has access to the requested resource.

:white_check_mark: Resource Access: If authorized, the user is granted access to the requested resource. Otherwise, an appropriate error message is returned.

:white_check_mark: This is a simplified example, and a complete implementation would involve additional error handling, database connection management, and user management functionalities.
